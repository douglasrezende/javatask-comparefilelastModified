List file in directory and verify if last modified time is greater than 20 seconds - JAVA TASK IBM STERLING B2B INTEGRATOR<br>

The Java Task service runs java code in Sterling B2B Integrator. It eliminates the need to create a custom service. You can either provide the java source code as a file path or you can include the code inline in BPML. There are two classes automatically available to you, one called wfc (which is an instance of the workflow context of the current process), and one called log (which is an instance of the XLogger). There must be a return of a string included in the code fragment. This string will go to the log.
